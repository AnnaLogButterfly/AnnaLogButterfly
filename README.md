# 👋 Hi there, I’m Anna Barnes

I'm a software developer who leads with clarity, kindness, and curiosity. I love untangling tricky bugs, building intuitive user experiences, and modernizing legacy systems into clean, maintainable, human-centered applications.

### 🛠️ Tech I Enjoy Working With
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Vue.js
- Backend: C#, Java, Python, SQL
- Tools & Tech: Docker, GitHub Actions, REST APIs, Swagger/OpenAPI
- Formerly: WPF/C#, legacy systems… turned modern 😉

### 🧭 What I’m All About
- 💡 Always asking "What could be better?"
- 🤝 Collaborating with empathy and respect
- 🐞 Debugging like a detective with a coffee habit
- 🌱 Currently learning more about AI, modern frontend frameworks, and making tech more accessible

### 🌈 Things I Care About
- Supporting LGBTQ+ inclusion and women in tech
- Work-life balance, sustainability, and intentional innovation
- Miniature schnauzers (I have three — they’re basically QA)
