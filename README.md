# 👋 Hi, I'm Anna Barnes

I'm a thoughtful software engineer who brings **Code, Kindness, and Curiosity** to every project.

I specialize in building modern, reliable systems — combining backend experience with **Python, REST APIs, and Docker**, and frontend development using **TypeScript and Vue.js**. I’m passionate about improving user experience, modernizing legacy systems, and integrating AI tools to push the boundaries of what software can achieve.

---

## 🛠️ What I’ve Been Working On  
- Modernized a legacy waitlist system at **Topgolf**, transitioning from a C#/WPF desktop app to a responsive Vue.js web platform  
- Led AI-assisted development practices for faster, higher-quality code reviews and test coverage  
- Integrated Apple Wallet into a high-volume loyalty platform at **NCR**, improving customer experience  
- Mentored junior developers through code reviews, pair programming, and collaborative learning  

---

## 💡 What I’m All About  
- Always asking *“What could be better?”* — and building toward it  
- Collaborating with empathy, respect, and a genuine desire to help others grow  
- Debugging like a detective with a coffee habit ☕🐞  
- Creating inclusive, collaborative engineering environments  
- Using emerging tech (especially AI) to make development smarter and more accessible  
- Writing clean, resilient code that serves real people — not just systems  
- Miniature schnauzers (I have three — they’re basically QA 🐶)

---

## 🚗 Tech on Wheels  
I’m endlessly curious about the intersection of **vehicles and technology** — especially in the realm of **autonomous driving**. I’ve spent time exploring, testing, and contributing to the open-source [OpenPilot](https://github.com/commaai/openpilot) project, and I love digging into how software can shape the future of mobility, safety, and driving experience.

## 🔍 Currently Exploring  
- AI-powered developer tools  
- UI accessibility and performance improvements  
- Creative uses of automation in real-world workflows  

---

## 📫 Let’s Connect  
I'm currently open to new opportunities and always up for meaningful conversations about tech, mentorship, or human-centered development.
